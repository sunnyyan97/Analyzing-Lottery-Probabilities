# Analyzing-Lottery-Probabilities

For this project I used Python to analyze probabilities of winning the lottery. I used a dataset containing historical data from the national 6/49 lottery in Canada. The dataset has data from 3,665 drawings from 1982 to 2018. 

Questions answered include:  
-What is the probability of winning the lotto with one ticket?    
     -or 40 tickets    
-What is probability of having 5 winning numbers out of 6 on a single ticket?  

Below is a sample of my final results. The full code can be seen in a Jupyter Notebook linked in the repository.
